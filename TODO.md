# Ideas
* Persist cards and items via config
  * Save to local storage
  * Chrome API doesn't work because using different chromium browsers
* Can import or export config
* Add new cards and items via UI
  * Requires an edit mode
* Edit mode to rename/delete items
* Uber search box that searches custom items and bookmarks
* Ability to add bookmark to a card
  * Would share ID as bookmark so updates to it reflected in the cards
